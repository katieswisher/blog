# Operation Code Blog
Hello! We are starting to collect blog posts for the Operation Code blog so we can build a backlog of content. We want to welcome all kinds of contributors, so if you have a blog post you would like to see on whatever blogging platform we use, read below. 
[Need Ideas?](https://github.com/OperationCode/blog/blob/master/Available_Topics.md)

## How To Contribute
1. Write your post in a [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) file.
2. Name your file with the Year-Month-date and your name. For example: `20190722_JaneSnuffy.md`.
3. Create a pull request to this repo.

### Our Terms
- If you submit a blog post to us to post, it must be *your work* and not someone else's. 
- By submitting a post to us, you agree to allow Operation Code to post your content to our blogging platform (we'll give you credit, of course!). 
- We cannot offer you money for your post. 
- Upon your request, we will remove your post.
- Your post will be reviewed for adherence to our Community Code of Conduct
- Spell Check your post before creating a pull request. 
- If you use any graphics, you must have the rights to use them.

### Frontmatter
We are still TBA for the blog platform we are going to use. We request that you submit a markdown file with the following administrative [frontmatter](###what-is-frontmatter): 


```
---
title: "New Blog"

submit_date: 07/22/2019

level: beginner
tags:
    - newbies
    - CSS
    - web development
    - how-to
--- 
```

## Additional Asks

**Tags:**
Please provide appropriate tags for your blog post. The ones above are simply for demonstration. 

**Sources:** We are big fans of citing your sources (especially documentation like the MDN)! If your blog references ‘the docs’, please provide a link to the documentation you are referencing. 


### What is Frontmatter? 
Frontmatter is a block of information that will help us programatically use the information you provide on the blog. It belongs at the very top of your markdown file. 
You can read about it at the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/); or for a neat look at where the concept came from, [Scribendi has a nice article](https://www.scribendi.com/advice/front_matter.en.html).
